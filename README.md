# Getting Started

### What is this project about?
It is a helper executable that issues commands for [GMusic Proxy](http://gmusicproxy.net/#command-line)

### Why?
If you use [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) as your music player, but also have access to Google Play Music, 
this is for you!

It allows you to download `m3u` playlists from Google Play Music and play them as a stream from any MPD 
client (such as [ncmpcpp](http://rybczak.net/ncmpcpp/)).

## Install
Install the executable using:

```bash
$ pub global activate gmusic_proxy_helper
```


## Usage

```bash
$ gph help
```

Will give you all the options.
